            Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes
            knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about
            the universe. The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient

              <!-- <h2>Coding is Love</h2> -->
              <p>
                The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated
                theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general
                relativity, proposed and published in 1905 and 1915,
                respectively. Special relativity applies to all physical
                phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains
                the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of
                nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm,
                including astronomy.

                The James Webb Space Telescope is a space telescope designed
                primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. The U.S. National
                Aeronautics and Space Administration led development of the
                telescope in collaboration with the European Space Agency and
                the Canadian Space Agency. The JWST was launched 25 December
                2021 on an ESA Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana and is
                intended to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA's
                flagship mission in astrophysics.

                Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that
                provides a description of the physical properties of nature at
                the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation

                science.

              <p>
                Nanotechnology, also shortened to nanotech, is the use of matter
                on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale for industrial
                purposes. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology
                referred to the particular technological goal of precisely
                manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale
                products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A
                more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently
                established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which
                defined nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at
                least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers

              <!-- <h2>Coding is Love</h2> -->
              <p>
                Superconductivity is a set of physical properties observed in
                certain materials where electrical resistance vanishes and
                magnetic flux fields are expelled from the material. Any
                material exhibiting these properties is a superconductor. Unlike
                an ordinary metallic conductor, whose resistance decreases
                gradually as its temperature is lowered even down to near
                absolute zero, a superconductor has a characteristic critical
                temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero.
                An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can
                persist indefinitely with no power source.

          <p>
            Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born
            theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest
            physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the
            theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to
            the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and
            quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.
            His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
            relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
            equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his
            services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of
            the law of the photoelectric effect". His intellectual achievements
            and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with
            "genius".

          <p>
            Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an
            English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian,
            and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") widely
            recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of
            all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key
            figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment.
            His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical
            Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687,
            established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal
            contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician
            Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.

            Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March
            2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author
            who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the
            Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.
            Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
            at the University of Cambridge. In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with
            an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease
            (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – ALS, for short) that gradually,
            over the decades, paralysed him. After the loss of his speech, he
            communicated through a speech-generating device initially through
            use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek
            muscle.
